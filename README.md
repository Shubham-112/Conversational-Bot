# Conversational-Bot
These bots take a user query pertaining to politics, news and general questions such as “Who was India’s first prime minister?” and then execute searches using APIs such as that of Googles to retrieve the data. The key concept here is to ensure that the idea of context is retained across queries. So the follow-up question may be something like “When was he born?” and the bot has to determine that the “it” in this sentence is the same as “the first Prime Minister” from the previous question.   These bots will have to use NLP libraries to parse and interpret the intent in the user’s responses.
